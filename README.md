# Process Engineering × Software Engineering

A collection of educational C projects exploring how programming can be used to model, simulate, and understand real engineering and industrial processes.

This repository combines:
- process-oriented thinking
- systems logic
- automation fundamentals
- low-level programming in C
- beginner-friendly software engineering practices

The projects are intentionally designed to remain simple, readable, and pedagogical while gradually introducing concepts commonly found in:
- process engineering
- embedded systems
- automation
- industrial control
- energy systems
- systems programming

# Philosophy of This Repository

The goal of this repository is not only to "make code work", but to understand:
- how systems behave
- how control logic works
- how software interacts with processes
- how engineering concepts can be translated into code

Most projects are implemented using beginner-friendly C syntax and simple logic to prioritize clarity and understanding over complexity.

# 1. Smart Kettle — Temperature Control Loop in C

A simple educational simulation of a temperature control loop for a household electric kettle.

This project demonstrates how basic control systems work using:
- loops
- conditional logic
- input validation
- process variables
- target states
- safety constraints

Although intentionally simple, the project introduces concepts widely used in real industrial and embedded systems.

## How to Compile
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror smart_kettle.c -o smart_kettle

## How to Run
./smart_kettle <current_temperature> <target_temperature>

### Example
./smart_kettle 20 80

Heating from 20°C to 80°C...

- Current temperature: 21°C
- Current temperature: 22°C
- Current temperature: 23°C
...
Current temperature: 80°C

Target temperature reached.

## Edge Cases Considered
- Invalid Temperature Range: ./smart_kettle -5 120
- Non-Numeric Input: ./smart_kettle hello 80
- Water Already Hotter Than Target: ./smart_kettle 90 60
- Missing/Extra Arguments: ./smart_kettle
